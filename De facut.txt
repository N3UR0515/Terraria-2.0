PANA AICI... dupa ce termini alea usoare fa astea:

3. Watch Chili's tut about 1D arrays and how chili uses it to optimize the snake game collisions, cuz this will be MUCH FASTER, and easier to use in the player-blockcollision( have to change the player-blockcollision again so that u have to use the 1D array )
4. Jump Mechanics    (Jump mechanics poate le faci dupa random generation of the map sau inainte... depinde daca ti se pare mai usor RGOTM (random generation of the map))
5. Random generation of the map, maybe expand the map if is the case
